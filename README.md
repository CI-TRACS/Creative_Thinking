# Creative_Thinking
Creativity is crucial not only to artists but also to scientists and engineers who are attempting to push the boundaries of knowledge. This workshop will begin by introducing what science informs us about creativity.

Drawing from the science and the experience of creative practitioners such as animators and comedians, the workshop will then describe conditions and activities that can help as well as hurt creativity.

This hands-on workshop will be conducted using the CyberCANOE running SAGE3 in Keller 103, and will also include a brief tutorial on how to use SAGE3 for information rich collaboration.
